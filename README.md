Landing Page Project with Flexbox
This is a landing page project for the online coding camp "The Odin Project". The project requires the use of Flexbox, a CSS layout module that provides a more efficient way to arrange and align elements within a container.

A navigation bar that allows users to jump to different sections of the page
A header section with a background image and a title
A main section with multiple subsections that showcase different features or services
A footer section with links to social media profiles and other relevant information
The project also requires the use of Flexbox to create a responsive and visually appealing layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used

CSS3

Getting Started
To view the landing page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The page is fully responsive and can be viewed on different screen sizes.
